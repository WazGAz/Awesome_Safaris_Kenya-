Or perhaps you’ll want to display each headline from a list of articles on a website. When you want to do the same action with every item in a list, you can use Python’s for loop.\n",

We could do this by retrieving each name from the list individually, but this approach could cause several problems. For one, it would be repetitive to do this with a long list of names. Also, we’d have to change our code each time the list’s length changed. A for loop avoids both of these issues by letting Python manage these issues internally. Let’s use a for loop to print out each name in a list of magicians:"

Basically, it uses whitespace to force you to write neatly formatted code with a clear visual structure. In longer Python programs, you’ll notice blocks of code indented at a few different levels. These indentation levels help you gain a general sense of the overall program’s organization.\n",
